You can see that A100 was 2.5 faster than V100, and H100 is ~3x faster than A100. But the intra-node speed of NVLink has only increased by 150GBps each generation. NVLink 5.0 doubled the speed over NVLink 4.0 so it catches up a little bit with the compute speed ups. But the speed up is still insufficient.
• Moreover, the first 4 generations of NVLink use identical NICs of the same 25GBps unidirectional bandwidth. They have just doubled and tripled the number of links to speed things up. So there was 0 progress in that technology.
• The inter-node situation isn’t any better with most NICs there doing 100 or 200Gbps, and some 400Gbps are starting to emerge. (correspondingly in GBps: 12.5, 25 and 50). It’s the same story here, some solutions provide dozens of NICs to get to higher speeds.
• Also typically with LLMs the payload is so large that network latency is often negligible for training. It’s still quite important for inference.
